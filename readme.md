Because why not?

# How to run?

Obviously, you need to clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/aukkawut/simpleApplicationDB.git
```

Assume that you know how to setup the python environment. First install all dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then just simply

```
python app.py
```

Edit necessary things (refers to documentation of `Flask` or other libraries) and that should be it. As-is should provide you necessary framework that is operational, but not effectively most efficient or good implementation.
